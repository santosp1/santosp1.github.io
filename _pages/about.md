I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from the [Federal Rural University of Pernambuco](https://ufrpe.br). 

I'm currently studying Data Analysis, Data Science and Data Engineering.  

This web site gathers my projects, studies and achievements. 

I still have a path to walk. This page will be filled eventually.

:)
